This section is designated towards finding any symptoms of any of the diseases in
the sidebar that might be visible when following this particular excercise. Any
specific data regarding how to proceed with this test will be mentioned below in
more detail.

## Specifics

This test is very similar to the calibration test that was performed earlier.
However, unlike the calibration test that only captured the edges, this test will
move the same red dot, in random directions at random speeds, to search for
various statistics including:

- Average velocity
- Average acceleration
- Accuracy of tracking
- Gaze fixation

When you are ready, click on the "Next" button below and click the "Start Capture"
button under the animation.
