This section serves the purpose of callibrating the eye-tracking and gaze estimation algorithms in order to properly track the eyes' movement. 
The steps for calibration and relatively simple and are mentioned in more detail below.

## Steps

1. This is where we will be callibrating your webcam.
2. Please remove any eyewear and look straight ahead at the screen and refrain from too much head movement.
3. A red circle with a cross (the target) will move across the screen.
4. Try to use your eyes to track the target and the algorithm will tune itself to your lighting conditions.

:::tip
It is recommended that you roll your eyes as a warmup before attempting the calibration.

5. In case the algorithm cannot find your eyes, it will pause and display warnings.
6. When ready, click on the button below to start the calibration.

:::warning
If any discomfort is felt while rolling the eyes, please stop using GazeDetect and talk to a medical professional.
