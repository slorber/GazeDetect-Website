According to the statistics and data collected, you have a <br/>

## **6%** chance of autism

<br/>
You exhibit very few symptoms such as jagged tracking, and rapid acceleration and
deceleration, but nowhere near the intensity of these symptoms exhbited in people
with autism.<br/>

## Video of Target Path

Below is the video of excercise given to you which can be used to compare
your eye movements in the following video.

import VideoExcercise from './module/analysis/excercise'

<VideoExcercise />

## How You Reacted to the Excercise

Below is what you submitted in response to the excercise, The markers on your face
were used to track your eyes and gather data. More info can be found [here](/docs/tracking/explanation),
or the Explanation found in the Tracking section.

## Accuracy of Tracking

Below will show the graph of how the accuracy of tracking had changed over time
in comparison to someone diagnosed with autism. According to previous data and
statistics, people with Autism end up having a fairly low accuracy when tracking
an object. This detail factored in when calculating your chance of having Autism.
You have completed this test with an accuracy of **86%** in comparison to the
Autism Benchmark which had an accuracy of **64%**. *According to the graph,
you were able to track the graph more accurately which can be seen in the lower
error rate.*

## Estimate of Gaze Fixation

Gaze fixation is also a keen indicator of Autism and can be calculated based on
how long a patient is fixated on an object or point. The following graph shows
the length of how long your gaze was fixed on the dot in comparison to the
Autism Benchmark.

## Velocity (px) vs Time (s)

Below is the velocity versus time graph for this particular excercise. According
to prior research conducted, people with autism cannot accurately track velocity
and tend to either move either really fast or really slow with a large different
from the target velocity. *As can be seen in the graph, you were able to stay at
or around the target velocity throughout the test.*

## Acceleration (px/s<sup>2</sup>) vs Time (s)

Below is the acceleration versus time graph for this particular excercise. According
to prior research conducted, people with autism tend to have a nuch higher acceleration
of eyes in comparison to others resulting the eye accelerating and decelerating extremely
rapidly which is a key detector of autism. Some data found in the velocity graph
may be omitted if it does not contribute any data. *The graph indicates that you
were able to stay around the target acceleration and deceleration rates almost
the whole time, with the exception of a few spikes.*
